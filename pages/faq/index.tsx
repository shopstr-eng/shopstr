By enabling P2PK in your profile, your shop‚Äôs payments are held in escrow until the lock expires. This protects both buyers and sellers: buyers know the funds are locked until goods are delivered, and sellers can still refund automatically via the configured ‚Äúrefund pubkeys‚Äù if a buyer never claims before the lock expires. To enable it, go to your Profile Settings, check ‚ÄúEnable Time‚ÄêLocked Payment (P2PK)‚Äù, pick a expire date/time, and optionally set refund pubkeys. Once active, any incoming Cashu payments for your listings will display a üîí ‚ÄúLocked for X day(s)‚Äù notice until they become redeemable after the lock time.",
