# Shopstr

## Overview

Shopstr is a global, permissionless marketplace built on the Nostr protocol, enabling Bitcoin commerce through decentralized communication and censorship-resistant transactions. It supports multiple payment methods including Lightning Network, Cashu ecash, and NWC (Nostr Wallet Connect). The platform provides a Progressive Web App (PWA) experience with client-side state management and server-side caching. Its core purpose is to offer a censorship-resistant, decentralized e-commerce solution.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Tech Stack Versions

- **Node**: 22.22.0 / **npm**: 10.9.4 (engines `>=22.4.0`)
- **Next.js**: 16.2.3 (Turbopack)
- **React / React-DOM**: 19.2.5
- **Tailwind CSS**: 4.2.2 via `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- **@heroui/react**: 2.8.10 (HeroUI v2 — the maintained successor to `@heroui/react` v2)
- **framer-motion**: 12.38.0
- **@cashu/cashu-ts**: 4.1.0 (migrated from 2.1.0 — see `.agents/skills/cashu-ts-migration/SKILL.md`)
- **@noble/hashes**: 2.x (requires explicit `.js` subpath imports, e.g. `@noble/hashes/utils.js`)

### Tailwind v4 Notes

HeroUI v2.8.10 replaced `@heroui/react@2.2.9`. The heroui plugin correctly uses `addBase()` for all non-class selectors (`:root`, `[data-theme]`) — no compatibility shim needed. CSS config uses `@import "tailwindcss"` + `@config "../tailwind.config.ts"` in `styles/globals.css`, and `@tailwindcss/postcss` in `postcss.config.cjs`. The app provider changed from `NextUIProvider` to `HeroUIProvider`. CSS variables renamed from `--nextui-*` to `--heroui-*`.

### Product Listing Page Routing Fix (PR #384)

`findListingBySlug` in `utils/url-slugs.ts` was only matching pubkey-suffixed slugs (e.g. `title-a1b2c3d4`), so uniquely-titled listings with plain slugs returned "not found". Fixed by adding a plain-title fallback match. Also added:

- Defensive "not found" guard: listing page only shows 404 when `productEvents.length > 0`
- `isLoading: true` during DB pre-load in `fetch-service.ts` to prevent premature 404 before relay fetch completes

## Recent Changes

### Broad API Rate Limiting

Added `utils/rate-limit.ts` with `applyRateLimit(req, res, bucket, opts, key?)` and applied per-IP buckets across every public API route — read endpoints (`fetch-products`, `fetch-messages`, `fetch-profile(s)`, `fetch-blossom`, `fetch-communities`, `fetch-relays`, `fetch-reviews`, `fetch-wallet`, `get-order-statuses`, `marketplace-stats`, `get-failed-publishes`), write endpoints (`update-order-status`, `mark-messages-read`, `delete-events`, `track-failed-publish`, `clear-failed-publish`, `discount-codes`), storefront (`storefront/lookup`, `storefront/verify-domain`), MCP (`mcp/index`, `mcp/create-order`, `mcp/verify-payment`, `mcp/api-keys`, `mcp/set-nsec`, `mcp/status`), and side-effecting helpers (`nostr/verify-nip05`, `og-preview`). Authenticated write/MCP routes layer a tighter per-pubkey or per-key bucket after auth so a single compromised credential cannot exhaust the connection pool. Limits are sized per endpoint cost (10/hr for `set-nsec`, 30/min for credential mgmt and DNS-touching routes, 60–120/min for write/MCP, 120–600/min for read).

**Deployment caveat**: the bucket store is a per-process in-memory `Map`. Under horizontal scaling the effective ceiling is `N × limit` where N is the instance count. This is intentionally a coarse safety net to keep one bad client from monopolising the DB pool — not a strict cryptographic bound. For a strict global limit, swap the store in `utils/rate-limit.ts` for Redis (interface is already `bucketName + key → { count, resetAt }`).

### Mint Operation Durability (Phase 4, P0)

Hardened the highest-stakes Cashu flow — the user-paid → claim-proofs path — against network blips, mint outages, rate limiting, and tab closes. Two new modules under `utils/cashu/`:

- **`mint-retry-service.ts`** — `withMintRetry()` wraps any cashu-ts call with bounded per-attempt timeouts (`newPromiseWithTimeout` + `AbortController`), exponential backoff with full jitter, total-time budget, and `RateLimitError.retryAfterMs` honoring. `isRetryableError()` retries 5xx `HttpResponseError`, `RateLimitError`, our own `Timeout` sentinel, and common network errors (`fetch failed`, `ECONNRESET`, etc.); 4xx-other-than-429 is treated as terminal. All failures wrap in a single `MintOperationError` with `cause` and `attempts` for callers to introspect.

- **`pending-mint-operations.ts`** — durable localStorage record (`shopstr.pendingMintQuotes`) of every mint quote the user has touched, with status lifecycle `awaiting_payment → paid_unclaimed → claimed | failed_terminal`. `recoverPendingMintQuotes()` walks all pending entries on demand, re-checks state with the mint, and finishes the claim using the same retry primitives. Quotes older than 7 days (mints typically retain ~24 h) are abandoned to avoid unbounded retries.

Wired into the app:

- **`components/wallet/mint-button.tsx`** records the pending quote immediately after `createMintQuoteBolt11`, marks `paid_unclaimed` once the mint reports PAID, and marks `claimed` only after the local proof persistence + `publishProofEvent` both succeed. The fragile inline polling loop was replaced with bounded retries; transient claim failures now leave the pending record in place and surface a "We'll automatically retry the claim the next time you open the app" notice instead of losing the user's sats.

- **`components/utility-components/mint-recovery-boot.tsx`** — single-shot boot component mounted in `pages/_app.tsx` inside both Nostr+Signer providers. On first signer availability it walks the pending store, finishes any unclaimed mints, and publishes the recovered proofs as a kind-7375 wallet event. Idempotent; cheap pre-check skips work when nothing is pending.

Validation: `tsc --noEmit` exit 0; jest 666 pass / 10 pre-existing UI failures (no regressions); 31 new tests cover the retry service (rate-limit awareness, exponential backoff, timeout, abort) and pending-ops store (CRUD, recovery success, ISSUED-terminal handling, boot-callback failure preserves pending record).

### `@cashu/cashu-ts` 2.1.0 → 4.1.0 Migration

Bumped past two major versions to unlock v3+ rate-limit-aware retry primitives, the `Amount` boundary type, the `KeyChain` API, and BOLT-method-typed quote helpers. Migration playbook captured as a reusable skill at `.agents/skills/cashu-ts-migration/SKILL.md`.

Highlights of changes applied to this codebase:

- **Class renames**: aliased `Mint as CashuMint` / `Wallet as CashuWallet` in every import to keep the `CashuMint`/`CashuWallet` call-site names working.
- **Method renames**: `createMintQuote` → `createMintQuoteBolt11`, `checkMintQuote` → `checkMintQuoteBolt11`, `mintProofs` → `mintProofsBolt11`, `createMeltQuote` → `createMeltQuoteBolt11`, `meltProofs` → `meltProofsBolt11`. Applied via bulk `sed` across components, MCP API routes, and tests.
- **Keysets**: `wallet.getKeySets()` → `wallet.keyChain.getKeysets()`. Local `MintKeyset` annotations re-aliased as `Keyset as MintKeyset` because the keyChain returns the domain `Keyset` class (only `.id` is read by app code).
- **`Amount` boundary (Choice B)**: kept internal types as `number` for this sat-only marketplace; converts at the cashu-ts boundary with `.toNumber()`. Pattern applied to every `acc + p.amount` reduce, every `meltQuote.amount + meltQuote.fee_reserve` arithmetic, and every formatter argument.
- **`getDecodedToken(token, [])`**: new mandatory second arg. Passing `[]` is safe for shopstr's standard hex (v1) keyset IDs.
- **Runtime `loadMint()`**: every `new CashuWallet(...)` site now calls `await wallet.loadMint()` before any other method (mint info / keysets are no longer constructor-loaded).
- **Pre-cashu cleanup**: `@noble/hashes/utils` → `@noble/hashes/utils.js` in 6 files (v2 dropped implicit `.js` resolution); replaced dropped `@cashu/crypto/modules/common` import in `fetch-service.ts` with `@cashu/cashu-ts` (re-exports `hashToCurve`).
- **Test mocks**: factory keys updated to new export names (`Mint`/`Wallet`), method keys to `Bolt11` variants, `getKeySets` wrapped as `keyChain: { getKeysets: ... }`, `loadMint: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined)` added to every wallet mock implementation. `jest.setup.js` adds a `Number.prototype.toNumber()` shim so raw numbers in mock fixtures stay compatible with production code that calls `.toNumber()` on `Amount`.

Validation: `tsc --noEmit` exit 0; `jest` 635 pass / 10 pre-existing UI failures (no regressions); dev server compiles cleanly on Next.js 16.2.3 + Turbopack.

### Node 18 → Node 22 Upgrade

`engines.node` raised to `>=22.4.0`. Running on Node 22.22.0 / npm 10.9.4. Dev server clean, 635/645 tests pass (10 pre-existing UI failures unrelated to the bump).

### Dev Server Infinite-Loop Fix

Root cause: Next.js 16 Turbopack's HMR WebSocket was blocked by the Replit cross-origin proxy because `allowedDevOrigins` was not set in `next.config.mjs`. With no WebSocket connection, the HMR client fell back to polling and triggered full page reloads every ~30–60 s. Each reload remounted `Shopstr`, fired `loadSigner` (which always created a fresh signer object reference), and restarted `fetchData`, producing the observed `GET /marketplace → fetch-relays → fetch-profile → GET /marketplace` cycle.

Three fixes applied:

1. **`next.config.mjs`** — added `allowedDevOrigins: [process.env.REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN]` so HMR WebSocket can connect from the Replit preview domain. HMR now shows `[HMR] connected` and `[Fast Refresh] done` instead of triggering page reloads.
2. **`nostr-context-provider.tsx` (`loadSigner`)** — added `lastSuccessfulSignerKeyRef` to skip `setSigner` (and therefore skip `fetchData`) when the serialized signer credentials haven't changed. Prevents spurious `fetchData` restarts from unrelated storage events (e.g. NWC string saves) that previously created a new signer object reference.
3. **`pages/index.tsx`** — narrowed the redirect effect dependency from the whole `signerContext` object to `signerContext.isLoggedIn`, preventing the effect from firing on every `SignerContextProvider` re-render when the login state itself hasn't changed.

### Onboarding Flow Redesign

- **Step 1 (keys.tsx)**: Simplified to only show a passphrase input. Removed public/private key display and copy handlers. Now redirects to user-type selection after completion.
- **Step 2 (user-type.tsx)**: New page for user role selection (Buyer or Seller). Routes to user-profile with a `?type=` query param.
- **Step 3 (user-profile.tsx)**: Now conditionally renders `BuyerProfileForm` (for buyers) or `UserProfileForm` (for sellers). Buyers finish onboarding here; sellers proceed to shop profile.
- **Step 4 (shop-profile.tsx)**: Updated button text to "Finish (or skip)".
- **New component (buyer-profile-form.tsx)**: Simplified profile form for buyers with only display_name, name, about, banner, and picture fields. Preserves existing profile data on save.

### SignInModal Redesign

- Added `sellerFlow?: boolean` prop to pre-select seller role during sign-up.
- New landing view with distinct Sign Up / Sign In flows.
- Sign-in (existing key) → routes to `/marketplace`.
- Sign-up (existing key) → routes to `/onboarding/user-type` (or with `?preselect=seller` when `sellerFlow` is true).
- "Create New Account" → routes to `/onboarding/keys`.
- Added eye toggle for password/passphrase visibility in nsec flows.

### File Uploader Fix

- Fixed `isIconOnly` prop to include loading state: `isIconOnly={isIconOnly || loading}`.
- `startContent` is now `undefined` when loading (prevents icon/spinner overlap).

## System Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript (App Router), React 18.
- **UI/UX**: NextUI, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for animations, PWA support.
- **State Management**: React Context API for various domains (products, profiles, shops, chats, reviews, follows, relays, media, wallet, communities).
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage for user preferences and authentication, service worker for caching.
- **Routing**: Middleware-based URL rewriting, dynamic routing, protected routes for authenticated operations. Friendly URL slugs for listings (title-based) and profiles (name-based) with collision handling via pubkey disambiguation. naddr/npub inputs still resolve but redirect to friendly slugs. URL slug utilities in `utils/url-slugs.ts`.

### Backend

- **Nostr Protocol Integration**: Multi-signer architecture (NIP-07, NIP-46, NIP-49), utilizing standard and custom Nostr event kinds for products (NIP-99), user metadata, shop profiles, direct messages (NIP-17), reviews (NIP-85), and communities (NIP-72).
- **Data Fetching & Caching**: Service layer with dedicated fetch functions, subscription-based real-time updates from Nostr relays, multi-relay querying with fallback, cache-first strategy with background refresh.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Stateless authentication via cryptographic signing, passphrase-based encryption (NIP-49), challenge-response pattern for secure operations.

### Payment Processing

- **Multi-Payment Support**: Lightning Network (invoice generation, LNURL), Cashu Ecash (token minting/redemption), NWC (Nostr Wallet Connect), and Zapsnags. Fiat-to-Bitcoin price conversion is supported for display purposes.
- **Payment Flow**: Invoice generation, ecash token redemption, quantity-based pricing.
- **Order Management**: Encrypted buyer-seller communication (gift-wrapped messages), payment confirmation proof, post-fulfillment review system.

### Media Handling

- **Blossom Protocol Integration (NIP-B7)**: Decentralized media storage, authenticated uploads, multi-file upload progress, image optimization (responsive srcset generation), maximum 100MB file size, automatic image compression for larger files.
- **Image Serving**: Automatic responsive image generation for nostr.build domains, fallback to original URLs, lazy loading.

### Community Features

- **Moderated Communities (NIP-72)**: Creation and management, post approval workflows, rich content feed rendering.
- **Social Graph & Trust**: Web of Trust (WoT) filtering based on follow relationships, configurable trust thresholds.

### Core Features

- **Order Summary Page**: Dedicated post-purchase page (`/order-summary`) displaying order confirmation with order ID, product details (single product or cart items with images, sizes, volumes, bulk options, quantities), payment method with human-readable names, subtotal/shipping/total cost breakdown, and delivery information (shipping address or per-item pickup locations). Data is passed via sessionStorage from the checkout flow. Includes "Continue Shopping" (primary), "Check Order Status", and "Contact Merchant" buttons (latter two shown when logged in). Also displays a "More From the Marketplace" section with randomized product recommendations excluding the seller's own products.
- **Bulk/Bundle Pricing**: Support for tiered pricing based on quantity.
- **Size and Volume Options**: Customizable product options for orders.
- **Pickup Location Selection**: Option for customers to select pickup locations for orders.
- **Order Status Persistence**: Database storage and API for tracking and updating order statuses.
- **Unread/Read Indicator System**: Visual indicators for unread messages and new orders, with persistence.
- **SSR OpenGraph Meta Tags**: Product (`/listing/`), shop (`/shop/`, `/shop/.../`), marketplace seller (`/marketplace/`), and community (`/communities/`) pages use `getServerSideProps` to fetch entity data from the PostgreSQL cache and render `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, and Twitter Card meta tags server-side. This ensures social media crawlers (which don't execute JS) see personalized link previews. Single-entity DB query functions in `utils/db/db-service.ts` (`fetchProductByIdFromDb`, `fetchProductByDTagAndPubkey`, `fetchProductByTitleSlug`, `fetchShopProfileByPubkeyFromDb`, `fetchProfilePubkeyByNameSlug`, `fetchShopPubkeyBySlug`, `fetchCommunityByPubkeyAndIdentifier`). SSR OG data flows from `getServerSideProps` → `pageProps.ogMeta` → `DynamicHead` component (via `_app.tsx`). Shared OG type/defaults in `components/og-head.tsx`.
- **Free Shipping Threshold**: Merchants can set a minimum order amount (with currency) in their shop profile settings. When a buyer's cart subtotal from a seller meets or exceeds the threshold, shipping costs for that seller's items are waived. Features include: shop profile form fields (`freeShippingThreshold`, `freeShippingCurrency` in `ShopProfile` type), a slide-in notification on add-to-cart (`components/free-shipping-notification.tsx` using Framer Motion), per-seller progress bars on the cart page, automatic shipping cost waiver in `cart-invoice-card.tsx` for all order types (shipping/combined/pickup selection), and strikethrough original shipping cost with "Free" badge on the order summary page.

### MCP Server (AI Agent Integration)

The platform exposes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enabling AI agents to programmatically participate in the marketplace as both buyers and sellers. Agents can browse products, place orders, create listings, manage shop profiles, upload media, send encrypted DMs, publish reviews, manage communities, configure relays/blossom servers, handle discount codes, and manage Cashu wallets — all using their Nostr keys for event signing.

#### Architecture

- **Server Factory**: `mcp/server.ts` — Creates the MCP server with registered tools and resources
- **Read Tools**: `mcp/tools/read-tools.ts` — Tools for browsing products, companies, reviews, and discount codes
- **Write Tools**: `mcp/tools/write-tools.ts` — Tools for full marketplace participation (profiles, listings, reviews, DMs, media, relay/blossom config, discount codes, Cashu wallet)
- **Purchase Tools**: Inline in `pages/api/mcp/index.ts` — Order creation, status, payment verification
- **Resources**: `mcp/resources.ts` — MCP resources (product catalog via `shopstr://catalog/products`)
- **Nostr Signing**: `utils/mcp/nostr-signing.ts` — Server-side Nostr event signing (`McpNostrSigner`), relay management (`McpRelayManager`), encrypted nsec storage, and `signAndPublishEvent()` utility
- **Auth Middleware**: `utils/mcp/auth.ts` — API key generation, validation, request authentication, nsec storage/retrieval, and `getAgentSigner()` for server-side signing
- **Metrics**: `utils/mcp/metrics.ts` — Request tracking, latency percentiles, rate limiting
- **API Key Management**: `pages/api/mcp/api-keys.ts` — CRUD endpoints for API keys
- **Order API**: `pages/api/mcp/create-order.ts` — Order creation, status, and listing endpoint
- **Payment Verification**: `pages/api/mcp/verify-payment.ts` — Lightning payment verification
- **Onboarding**: `pages/api/mcp/onboard.ts` — Zero-touch agent registration with optional nsec storage
- **Set Nsec**: `pages/api/mcp/set-nsec.ts` — Endpoint for agents to securely set their nsec after onboarding
- **Status**: `pages/api/mcp/status.ts` — Service health and metrics
- **Agent Manifest**: `pages/api/.well-known/agent.json.ts` — Machine-readable service description (v2.0.0)

#### Payment Methods

- **Lightning**: Generates a Cashu mint quote (bolt11 invoice) via `@cashu/cashu-ts`. Agent pays the invoice, then calls `verify_payment` to confirm. Default mint: `https://mint.minibits.cash/Bitcoin`.
- **Cashu**: Agent provides a serialized Cashu token string. Server verifies and redeems the tokens.

#### Permission Levels

- `read` — Browse-only access (search products, view profiles/reviews)
- `read_write` — Browse + purchase (place orders, verify payments)
- `full_access` — Full marketplace participation (all read/write tools + server-side Nostr event signing). Requires nsec stored during onboarding or via `/api/mcp/set-nsec`.

#### Server-Side Nostr Signing

Agents with `full_access` permission have their Nostr private key (nsec) stored encrypted in the database using AES-256-GCM. The encryption key is configured via the `MCP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. The `McpNostrSigner` class provides `sign()`, `encrypt()`, `decrypt()`, and `getPubKey()` methods without browser dependencies. Events are signed server-side, cached to the database, and published to relays via `McpRelayManager` (using `nostr-tools` SimplePool).

#### Database Tables

- `mcp_api_keys` — API keys with hashed secrets, permissions (read/read_write/full_access), usage tracking, and optional encrypted_nsec for server-side signing
- `mcp_orders` — Orders placed through the MCP/API with payment and status tracking

#### Authentication

API keys are created via the `/settings/api-keys` UI page, the `/api/mcp/api-keys` endpoint, or the zero-touch `/api/mcp/onboard` endpoint. Keys use PBKDF2 hashing and Bearer token authentication. Three permission levels: `read` (browse only), `read_write` (browse + purchase), and `full_access` (full marketplace participation with Nostr signing). Key prefix: `sk_`. Agents can set their nsec post-onboarding via `POST /api/mcp/set-nsec`.

### Order Address Change

Buyers can change the shipping address for their orders from the Orders Dashboard. The address column shows a "Change Address" link for purchases (non-sale orders) that have an address. Clicking it opens the `AddressChangeModal` (`components/utility-components/address-change-modal.tsx`), which sends a gift-wrapped Nostr DM to the seller with the new address and updates the local order state.

### Subdomain Shop / Storefront System

Sellers can configure branded storefronts accessible at `/shop/[slug]` URLs. The system allows full customization of the buyer's shopping experience.

#### Architecture

- **Storefront Routes**: `pages/shop/[slug].tsx` (shop home), `pages/shop/[...shopPath].tsx` (sub-pages: orders, wallet, community, custom pages)
- **Storefront Layout**: `components/storefront/storefront-layout.tsx` — Full-featured storefront with navbar, hero, product grid, sections, and footer. Applies CSS variables for theming and adds `sf-active` class to body to hide the global Shopstr nav.
- **Theme Wrapper**: `components/storefront/storefront-theme-wrapper.tsx` — Wraps existing pages (like `/listing`) when visited from a storefront context. Uses `sessionStorage` key `sf_seller_pubkey` to detect the active storefront.
- **Proxy/Middleware**: `proxy.ts` — Extended with subdomain routing: `*.shopstr.market` subdomains rewrite to `/shop/[subdomain]`.

#### Storefront Config (stored in ShopProfile.content.storefront)

- `colorScheme` — Custom colors (primary, secondary, accent, background, text)
- `productLayout` — `grid` | `list` | `featured`
- `landingPageStyle` — `hero` | `classic` | `minimal`
- `shopSlug` — URL slug (registered via `/api/storefront/register-slug`)
- `customDomain` — Custom domain (configured via `/api/storefront/custom-domain`)
- `fontHeading` / `fontBody` — Google Fonts selection
- `sections` — Ordered list of landing page sections
- `pages` — Custom pages with own sections
- `footer` — Footer config (text, social links, nav links, Powered by Shopstr)
- `navLinks` — Custom navigation links
- `showCommunityPage` / `showWalletPage` — Toggle pages

#### Section Types

12 section types in `components/storefront/sections/`: `hero`, `about`, `story`, `products`, `testimonials`, `faq`, `ingredients`, `comparison`, `text`, `image`, `contact`, `reviews`. Rendered by `components/storefront/section-renderer.tsx`.

#### Helper Components

- `storefront-hero.tsx` — Full-width hero with banner, picture, and CTA
- `storefront-footer.tsx` — Customizable footer with social links, "Powered by Shopstr"
- `storefront-product-grid.tsx` — Paginated product grid/list/featured layout
- `storefront-community.tsx` — Community feed for the shop's NIP-72 community
- `storefront-wallet.tsx` — Embedded Cashu wallet page
- `storefront-orders.tsx` — Embedded orders page (dynamic import)
- `storefront-my-listings.tsx` — Seller's own listings (visible to shop owner)
- `storefront-order-confirmation.tsx` — Post-purchase confirmation with upsells
- `section-renderer.tsx` — Dispatches to correct section component by type

#### API Routes

- `GET /api/storefront/lookup?slug=` — Look up pubkey by shop slug
- `POST /api/storefront/register-slug` — Register/update a shop slug
- `POST /api/storefront/custom-domain` — Register custom domain + return DNS instructions
- `GET/DELETE /api/storefront/custom-domain?pubkey=` — Get or remove custom domain

#### Database Tables

- `shop_slugs` — Maps pubkey → slug (one per seller, unique constraint on slug)
- `custom_domains` — Maps pubkey → custom domain (verified flag)

#### Settings UI

Shop profile settings (`/settings/shop-profile`) now uses `ShopProfileForm` component from `components/settings/shop-profile-form.tsx` with two tabs:

1. **Basic Info** — Name, about, banner, picture, free shipping threshold
2. **Storefront** — Shop URL slug, landing page style, product layout, color scheme (with 7 presets), typography, navigation links, homepage sections builder, custom pages, community/wallet toggles, footer editor, custom domain, preview modal, remove storefront

Storefront editor sub-components (in `components/settings/storefront/`):

- `section-editor.tsx` — Accordion-style editor for all 12 section types with type-specific fields
- `footer-editor.tsx` — Footer text, social links, nav links, "Powered by Shopstr" toggle
- `page-editor.tsx` — Custom page management with slug auto-generation
- `storefront-preview-modal.tsx` — Approximate live preview modal with all color/font/layout settings

#### Cart Page Storefront Integration

`pages/cart/index.tsx` wrapped in `StorefrontThemeWrapper` — reads `sf_seller_pubkey` from sessionStorage, filters cart items to only show the active storefront seller's items, shows a banner if other sellers' items were excluded, and wraps the full page with the storefront nav/footer.

#### Custom Domain Page

`pages/shop/_custom-domain.tsx` — Shopstr-branded landing page for custom domains; looks up shop by domain via `/api/storefront/lookup?domain=`, shows `ShopstrSpinner` while loading, falls back to "Visit Shopstr" link if domain not found.

#### Profile Dropdown

`components/utility-components/profile/profile-dropdown.tsx` updated to add `storefront` key (GlobeAltIcon) that links to the seller's storefront if configured, with neo-brutalist styling.
